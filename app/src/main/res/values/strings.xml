Can We Fix It?
Bob the Builder
Album Bob the Builder: The Album

[Chorus]
Bob the Builder!
Can we fix it?
Bob the Builder!
Yes we can!

[Verse 1]
Scoop, Muck and Dizzy, and Roley too
Lofty and Wendy join the crew
Bob and the gang have so much fun
Working together they get the job done

[Chorus]
Bob the Builder!
Can we fix it?
Bob the Builder!
Yes we can!

[Verse 2]
Pilchard and Bird, Travis and Spud
Playing together like good friends should

[Chorus]
Bob the Builder!
Can we fix it?
Bob the Builder!
Yes we can!

Bob the Builder: Obviously the king of rap!! This song is really sick, I be bumpin it all day. Can’t wait for his next work of art.

    What show is this a theme song for?
